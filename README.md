# Forager Mod: Grimoires
## Steam Listing: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2068521399
This mod adds in Grimoires which essentially are infinite use scrolls/sigils. They are crafted through the Lecturn structure which is unlocked in Thaumaturgy, and initially lets you craft the Druid, Miner, Wizard, and Build Grimoires which have the same effect as their respective scroll (The Builder one is called Build Grimoire as the text got too long). If you have Summoning, you also get access to the Slime, Skull, Beet, and Toxic Grimoire which have the same effect as their respective sigil.

The crafting recipes are in the images, but essentially all the Grimoires require 5 Royal Clothing, 10 Star Fragments, and 25 of their single use consumable. The idea was that late in the game when you have lots of resources to craft the scrolls it starts to become annoying to craft stacks everytime, so if you're able to acquire 25 scrolls or sigils, being able to have an infinite use version would help with farming. Be aware, though, that this might become overpowered if you get to the point where you can kill the bosses very quickly, since you can essentially spam summon them a lot and get lots of spirit orbs. If you want to use them up faster, consider using Kyo's Orbs: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1962130941

I'm not super great at pixel art, so hopefully as I improve I'll update the Lecturn's art. I also plan to add in more Grimoires as time goes on, including looking at adding varients of mod items potentially.

You can use my mod in any shape or form however you want as long as you credit me.
